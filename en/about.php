        <p>
            Creations JY is led by Yasemin Jemmely, a passionate maker based in Gruyère, Switzerland,
            who gives forgotten objects a second life through upcycling.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every piece is crafted from found and reclaimed materials, carefully selected and combined.
            The result is unique objects full of character, blending vintage charm with a sustainable mindset.
        </p>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Upcycling Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            Upcycling means transforming existing materials or objects into something new,
            without breaking them down completely. It is a creative, eco-friendly and responsible approach.
        </p>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Workshop in Gruyère</h2>
        <p>
            Pieces are imagined and made in a small workshop in Gruyère. By appointment, it may be possible
            to see selected creations in person or discuss custom projects.
